`<secret-scope>` Managing secrets begins with creating a secret scope. A secret scope is collection of individual secrets identified by a name that must be unique within a workspace. The names are considered non-sensitive and are readable by all users in the workspace. A workspace is limited to a maximum of 100 secret scopes.
