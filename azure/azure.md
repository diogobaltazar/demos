A ``tenant`` is the Azure Active Directory entity that encompasses a whole ``organization``.
This ``tenant`` has at least one ``subscription`` and ``user``.
A `user` is associated to **one only** ``tenant``. A `user` is associated to **at least one** ``subscription``.
Every `resource` is associated to **one only** `subscription`.  

The `subscription` is related to a `directory`. The `roles` of an `user` is seen in subcriptions.
