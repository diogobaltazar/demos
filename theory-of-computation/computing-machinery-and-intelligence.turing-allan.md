Equivalent:
+ *Can machines think?*
+ *Are there digital computers that would do well on the imitation game?*
+ *Are there discrete state machines that would do well on the imitation game?*
+ *granted a digital computer with appropriate storage capacity, speed of response and a suitable program, would it do well on the imitation game?*

imitation game:
+ (A) man deceiving as to behave as a woman
+ (B) woman behaving as a woman
+ (C) interrogator trying to understand who's the woman: (A) or (B)
+ replace (A) with a digital computer

MAchine :=
+ digital computer
+ carry operations as a human comptuer (follow fixed rules and these alone)
+ composed of:
    + store
        + finite/infinite (theoretical)
        + space to store data
        + space to store instructions
    + executive unit: instructions execution engine
    + control: coordinate the executive unit

Digital Computer :=
+ universal computers: able to mimic any other machine
+ discrete state machines

Limitations of DSM proved by mathematical logic:
+ (GÃ¶del) In a sufficiently powerful logical system, statements can be formulated which can be neither proved nor disproved whithin the system, unless the system itself is inconsistent;
+ (Turing) Infinite State Machines have questions to which they'll either give **false answers** or to which **they'll never reply with an answer**. The human is not subject to this problem.

table of instructions
+ program
+ each instruction has at most the minimal unit composite length
+ intruction (example): *add the value on cell 623 to the value on cell 867D and write the result to the latest*

## questions
+ What's a sufficiently powerful logical system?
+ Why isn't the human intellect subject to these limitations?
+ what's the Halting Problem
+ Why does each instruction needs to have at max the minimum unit composit lenght in the computer storage?
+ why does a digital computer need to have adequate storage to mimic a machine? How do the states of one machine relate to the storage?
+ What in the architecture of a universal machine allows it to mimic any other machine?
